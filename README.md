# hello-world
This is my hello-world to the world. Hello.
Some may say I'm a noodler, some a mad scientist (though not mad, and not a scientist). I prefer my punctuation inside of parentheses and quotation marks, but I'm trying to get comfortable with both. I'm learning code so that I may expand on what started as a journey into circuit-bending. I play the fiddle, and I run cable and hang T.V.'s. Improvisation is a strength of mine. (Logic may be a weekness.)
